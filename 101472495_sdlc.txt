DevOps plays a critical role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) by bridging the gap between development and operations. It enhances collaboration, automates workflows, and enables continuous 
delivery, which improves software quality and reduces time-to-market. Integrating DevOps into the SDLC promotes a culture of accountability, faster response to customer needs, and continuous improvement.
