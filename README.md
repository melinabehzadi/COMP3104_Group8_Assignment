CI/CD Pipeline:
The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The CI pipeline configuration is defined in .github/workflows/ci.yml. It automates the process of installing dependencies and running tests whenever code is pushed to the repository.


Branching Strategy:
Each member has their own branch named `STUDENTID-Name`. All changes are
merged into the `main` branch via Pull Requests.
