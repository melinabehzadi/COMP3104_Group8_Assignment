My name is Melina Behzadi Nejad. 

Git Best Practices:

1. Commit often and keep the commit messages meaningful and concise.

2. Always work on feature branches to prevent conflicts and ensure that
`main` remains stable.

3. Review pull requests thoroughly before merging to the `main` branch
to ensure code quality.

4. Use rebase to clean up commit history before merging feature
branches.
